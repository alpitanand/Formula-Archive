    <tr>
    <td>Wave</td>
    <td>it is a disturbance which travels through the medium due to repeated periodic motion of particles of the medium about their equilibrium position</br>
    Examples are sound waves travelling through an intervening medium, water waves, light wavees etc.
    </td></tr>
    
    <tr>
    <td>Mechanical waves</td>
    <td>Waves requiring material medium for their propagation are called mechanical waves.these are governed by Newton's law of motion.</br>
    Sound waves are mechanical waves in atmosphere between source and the listener and require medium for their propagation</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Non mechanical waves</td>
<td>those waves which doesnot require material medium for their propagation are called non mechanical waves.
    </td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Transverse waves</td>
<td>These are such waves where the displacement or oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Longitudinal waves</td>
<td>Longitudinal waves are those waves in which displacement or oscillations in medium are parallel to the direction of propagation of wave for example sound waves.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Equation of harmonic wave</td>
<td>At any time t, displacement y of the particle from it's equilibrium position as a function of the coordinate x of the particle is y(x,t) = Asin(ωt-kx) where,
    A is the amplitude of the wave</br>
k is the wave number</br>
ω is the angular frequency of the wave</br>
and (ωt-kx) is the phase</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Wave number</td>
<td>Wavelength λ and wave number k are related by the relation k = 2n/λ</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Frequency</td>
<td>Time period T and frequency f of the wave are related to ω BY ω/2N = f = 1/T</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Speed of wave</td>
<td>speed of the wave is given by v = ω/k = λf </td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Speed of transverse wave</td>
<Td>Speed of a transverse wave on a streched string depends on tension and the linear mass density of the string not on frequency of the wave i.e., v = √T/μ</br>
    T = Tension in the string</br>
μ = Linear mass density of the string</Td></tr>


<tr>
<td>Speed of Longitudinal waves</td>
    <td>Speed of longitudinal waves in a medium is given by v = √B/ρ</br>
    B = Bulk modulus
    ρ = Density of the medium and speed of the longitudinal waves in ideal gas is v = √γP/ρ
where ρ is the density of the gas
and y = C<sub>p</sub>/C<Sub>v</Sub></td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Principle of superposition</td>
<td>When two or more waves transverse through the same medium, the displacement of any particle of rhe medium is the sum of the displacement that the individual waves would give it</br>
y = Σy<sub>i</sub>(x,t)</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Interference of waves</td>
<td>If two sinusoidal waves of the same amplitude and wavelength travel in the same direction they interface to produce a resultant sinusoidal wave travelling in that direction with resultant wave given by the relation</br>
y'(x,t) = [2A<sub>m</sub>cos(u/2)]sin(ωt-kx + u/2) where u is the phase difference between two waves.</br>
If u=0 then interference would be fully constructive</br>
If u = n then waves would be out of phase and there interference wouldbe destructive</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Reflection of waves</td>
<td>When a pulse or travelling wave encounters any boundary it gets reflected.If an incident wave is represented by y<sub>1</sub>(x,t) = Asin(ωt-kx) then reflected wave at rigid boundary is y<sub>r</sub>(x,t) = Asin(ωt+kx+n) = -Asin(ωt+kx)
    and for reflections at open boundary reflected wave is given by y<sub>r</sub>(x,t) = Asin(ωt + kx)</td></tr>


<tr>
<td>Normal modes of streched string</td>
<td>Frequency of transverse motion of streched string of lengh L fixed at both the ends is given by f=nv/2L where n=1,2,3,4......</br>
The set of frequencies given by above relation are called normal modes of oscillation of the system.</br>
Mode  n =1 is called the fundamental mode with frequency f<syb>1</syb> = v/2L.</br>
second harmonic is the oscillation mode with n = 2 and so on.</br>
Thus the string has infinte number of possible frequency of vibration which are harmonics of fundamental frequency f<sub>1</sub> such that f<sub>n</sub> = nf<sub>1</sub></td></tr>


<tr>
<td>Beats</td>
<td>Thus beats arises when two waves having slightly differing frequencies v<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>2</sub> and compareable amplitude are superposed</br>
Here interfering waves have slightly differing frequencies v<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>2</sub> such that |v<sub>1</sub> - v<sub>2</sub>|<<(v<sub>1</sub>)/2</br>
</td></tr>


<tr>
<td>Doppler effect</td>
<td>doppler effect is a change in the observed frequency of thewave when the source S and the observer O move relative to the medium.</br>There are three different ways we can analyse this change in frequency</br>
1)When oberser is stationary and source is approching observer is</br>
v=v<sub>0</sub> (1 + v<sub>a</sub>/V)</br>
where v<sub>a</sub> = velocity of source relative to the medium</br>
v= velocity of wave relative to the medium</br>
V= observed frequency of sound waves in term of source frequency </br>
v<sub>0</sub>= source frequency</br>
Change in frequency when source recedes from stationary observer is v=v<sub>0</sub>(1 - v<sub>a</sub>/V)
observer at rest measures high frequency when source apprroches it and it measures low frequency when source recedesfrom the observer</br>
2) Oberver is moving with a velocity v<sub>0</sub> towards source and the source is at rest is v = v<sub>0</sub>(1+V<sub>0</sub>/V)</br>

3) Both source and the observer are moving then frequency observed by observer is v = v<sub>0</sub>(V + V<sub>0</sub>)/(V+V<sub>0</sub>) </br>
and all the symbols have respective meanings as told earlier</td></tr>
